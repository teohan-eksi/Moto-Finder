# MotoFinder


A Python scraping script to gather currently available motorcycle listings from one of the most popular second-hand market places.

It lets you choose a city among 3 predefined options, gets your price range(min and max prices) and how many pages you want to scrape, then returns hundreds of items in a txt file according to your search parameters.
